## How to Play

| Input | Action | Notes |
| ----- | ------ | ----- |
| `‚Üë` | Drive forward | Hold to build momentum; tank keeps rolling via Matter physics. |
| `‚Üì` | Drive in reverse | Useful for braking or backing out of tight alleys. |
| `‚Üê / ‚Üí` | Pivot chassis | Applies torque, letting you swing the turret body before shooting. |
| `Shift` | Fire turret | Fires the laser instantly on key press; beam can ricochet off walls and pillars. |
| `R` | Restart scene | Flushes audio, tweens, and key bindings, then rolls a fresh maze. |

All bindings are defined when the player tank is spawned in `src/index.js`; switch to other keys or add gamepad listeners there if needed.

## Here are some buzzwords that have something to do with this repo:

- Phaser 3
- WebGL
- webpack
- Kenney
- npm
- ESLint
- Prettier

## The game is WIP. I plan on implementing multiplayer using Peer.js
